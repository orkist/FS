          <p><img src="images/instructor_1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="name">James Barnett grew up in Silver Spring MD and attended Springbrook High School.  Throughout his childhood he played many sports and stuck with competitive diving and competed for ten years until he finished his career upon graduating from the University of Virginia.  Throughout his diving career he served as a dive coach to summer league teams in Montgomery County MD where he coached teams of about 50 kids between ages 5 and 18.  After graduating form UVa, James went into consulting at Accenture, followed by Booz Allen while he was an active volunteer for the Human Rights Campaign before joining [solidcore].  James is currently enrolled at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business to get his Masters in Business Administration.

James started his [solidcore] journey as a client in April of 2014 and after 5 months of taking classes and lots of [encouragement] from other coaches and leadership he decided to start coach training.  James has been a solidcore coach since December 2014, and has been the lead of the Shaw studio since March 2015.  Shortly after becoming lead he began his Master Training with Alex Perrin in June and became a Master Trainer in July of 2014.  He immediately started training coaches with fellow Master Trainer Jo and has completed two training classes to date and is looking forward to work with his next group of trainees.

James has lives in DC right off 14th street and loves his hyper active and busy life.  When he’s not [coaching], [training], or studying you’ll see him out with his gaggle of friends enjoying a drink at Dacha or Barcelona and Sundays he plays kickball on Stonewall Sports League.  He’s looking forward to beach season and all of the trips to Rehoboth he’ll make this summer!</p>

She left Denver to attend the University of Texas at Austin (hook 'em horns!) and majored in psychology and French. There, she tried her first Pure Barre class in 2010 and was immediately hooked! She then moved to DC in 2011 to pursue her doctorate in clinical psychology at GWU. Andrea was beyond thrilled that DC was finally getting a Pure Barre and even suggested the location--she lives in the apartments upstairs! Now, she's living the dream, being a mere 10 steps from the studio which means no excuses for getting on her LTB. She is so excited to be a part of not only a great workout, but a wonderful community!</p>

Born and raised in Venezuela, Natalia moved to New York to pursue a career in fashion. When she discovered Soul as a rider she found that it filled a void in her life. After 12 years working in the fashion industry, Natalia decided she wanted to pay it forward. Now an official member of the SoulCycle family, Natalia can’t wait to take her riders on the Soul journey. In class, expect to work hard and party harder!</p>
